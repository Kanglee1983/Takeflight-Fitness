	 <h1>Myths</h1>
	 
	 <img src="images/muscle.jpg" width="1000px" height="460px" alt="">
	 
	 		<p>When it comes to the fitness world theres is a lot of information online to grasp. 
	 		One thing we need to know some of this information that we mary retain can be a myth. 
			 I would like to go over a few of these myths with you. 
	 		In order be a great bodybuilder means you have to do more than just lift heavy stuff and putting it back down; 
	 		you have to do your research and constantly keep up with the new and innovative training styles and techniques.
	  		There is a lot of good information out there to learn and grow from, but mixed in with all the great info comes a lot of crap! 
	  		You have to sift through the clutter to find the real information gems. 
	  		The myths surrounding bodybuilding are very prevalent and prey on our intuition. 
	  		They seem to make sense until you really understand how things work.</p>
  	
  		<h3>Higher Reps And Lighter Weights For Muscle Definition</h3>
  	
  			<p>Defined muscle comes from having low body fat, and the peaks and valleys between each muscle which give them more of a separated look. 
  			The way to maximize these peaks and valleys is to build muscle. If you've been lifting heavy, then suddenly switch to light weights, 
  			you may lose muscle because there is less stimulation. When muscle loss occurs the body will burn less calories daily which will make burning fat even harder!</p>
  	
  			<p>If you want to get defined muscle, keep lifting heavy! Focus more on the intensity of the workout by shortening rest periods, adding supersets and drop sets, throwing in some cardio and of course cleaning up your diet is a must!</p>
  
  		<h3>Heavier Weight = Bigger Muscle</h3>
  	
  			<p>As much as lifting heavy weight is the key to bodybuilding success, piling on the weight week after week may cause more harm than good. Often, what happens when an exercise gets too heavy is a loss of muscle control and lifting form goes out the window. 
  			This results in more of the bad aches and pains and a greater risk of injury!</p>
  	
  			<p>Always choose a weight that allows you complete no less than 6 reps with good muscle control and form. 
  			Feel the load in the target muscle and always purposely flex at the peak of each movement. 
  			With that said you should be lifting a weight that causes the worked muscles to fatigue after 10-15 reps max,
  			 or else you need to increase your lifting weight. </p>

  		<h1>Training Tips</h1>
  	<img src="images/woman.jpg" width="700px" height="390px" alt="">
  	
  		<h3>Pushing Up With Shoulders</h3>
  			
  		<p>This is a very common one that beginners and many experienced lifters doing all the time. It is when a lifter allows their shoulders to move forward/up in the direction of a chest press. 
  		This takes a lot of the tension off the chest and puts it into anterior deltoids. If you always complain about your shoulders getting a better workout than your chest, this one is for you.</p>

		<h3>Solution:</h3> 
			
		<p>Keep your scapula retracted and pined to the bench throughout the entire range of the lift. As you begin your lift, 
		imagine your chest moving up into the motion as you push. Right away you should feel your chest doing way more work. This may take some getting used to in the beginning, 
		but after a few workouts, you'll see and feel the difference.</p>
			
		<h3>Locking Elbows</h3>
		
		<p>Time under tension is a very important rule when it comes to bodybuilding. The idea is to keep the working muscle group under the load of the weight from the first to the last rep. 
		What I see happening too often, are people locking their elbows during their chest pressing exercises. That lockout point cuts the tension to the chest and actually lets it rest. This is a no, no.</p>

 		<h3>Solution:</h3>
			
		<p>As you approach the finish point of each repetition, be sure to stop the motion just short of lockout. Be sure to pause for a beat and squeeze the pectoralis. 
		You may feel like you burn out a little sooner, but you'll be happy with the new level of soreness after the workout.</p>  	
  		
  		<h3>Going Too Low</h3>
		
		<p>Everybody talks about getting the bar all the way down to the chest as best practice on the bench press. This is fine for some physiques, but for most of us, it will hamper growth and potentially cause injury. 
		Going too low on chest exercises can cause too much of a stretch in the outer chest and shoulder area. 
		This takes more tension off the chest muscles and will weaken them. You want to have a strong and effective bench in order to thicken up the chest.</p>

 		<h3>Solution:</h3>
			
		<p>As you lower the weight, focus on how much of the load you can feel in the chest. If there comes a point where the feeling goes from a deep muscular sensation to a hard, ropey, fibrous pain. That's the point you've gone too low. Instead, start to push the weight back up, just before that point. You'll notice bigger pumps after each set.</p>
