	 <h1>Muscle Myths</h1>
	 <p>To be a great bodybuilder means you have to do more than just lifting heavy stuff and putting it back down; you have to do your research and constantly keep up with the new and innovative training styles and techniques. There is a lot of good information out there to learn and grow from, but mixed in with all the great info comes a lot of crap! You have to sift through the clutter to find the real information gems. The myths surrounding bodybuilding are very prevalent and prey on our intuition. They seem to make sense until you really understand how things work.</p>
