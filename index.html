	 <h1>Higher Reps And Lighter Weights For Muscle Definition</h1>
	 <p>Defined muscle comes from having low body fat, and the peaks and valleys between each muscle which give them more of a separated look. The way to maximize these peaks and valleys is to build muscle. 
	 If you've been lifting heavy, then suddenly switch to light weights, you may lose muscle because there is less stimulation. 
	 Whatâ€™s more is, when muscle loss occurs the body will burn less calories daily which will make burning fat even harder! If you want to get defined muscle, keep lifting heavy! 
	 Focus more on the intensity of the workout by shortening rest periods, adding supersets and drop sets, throwing in some cardio and of course cleaning up your diet is a must!</p>
